      These charts represent the number of 911 calls for each three types over
      time for each SCA in a given precinct. Each type of SCA's total 911 calls
      are split into three types: Gunshots In Progress (SHOTSIP), Gunshots Just
      Happened (SHOTSJH), and Gunshots Detected by ShotSpotter (SHOTSPT).
      Because the nature of this research is investigating ShotSpotter, the time
      frames are limited to ShotSpotter involvement, if the given SCA has a
      ShotSpotter.
