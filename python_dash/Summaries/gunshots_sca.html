    <p class="lead">
      Detroit's 11 police precincts are subdivided into 131 police scout car
      areas (SCA) that officers are assigned to patrol. The map below displays
      the total amount of gunshot-related 911 calls the DPD has received for
      each SCA from 2016 to the present. Note that in particular, some SCAs in
      the 9th precinct, where ShotSpotter was initially rolled out and continues
      to stay, have higher levels of gunshot-related 911 calls, moreso than some
      SCAs in the 8th precinct, another location where ShotSpotter was initially
      implemented.
